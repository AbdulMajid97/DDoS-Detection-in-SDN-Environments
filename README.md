# DDoS Detection in SDN Environments

A machine learning and deep learning-based solution to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments. This project leverages both classical ML models (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, etc.) and a custom deep learning model in PyTorch to identify malicious traffic patterns, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing benign from malicious flows.
