# DDoS-Shield-for-SDN
 DDoS Detection in SDN Environments A machine learning and deep learning-based solution to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments. This project leverages both classical ML models (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, etc.) and a custom deep learning model in PyTorch to identify malicious traffic patterns, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing benign from malicious flows.  Features Dataset Preprocessing: A dedicated preprocessing pipeline for handling missing values, encoding, and feature scaling, with clear insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Classical Machine Learning Models: Implements a range of traditional models including Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and more, each evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Deep Learning Model: A custom neural network architecture built with PyTorch, featuring dropout regularization and TensorBoard integration for real-time training insights. Modular Project Structure: Well-organized, with separate modules for data processing, model training, and evaluation, making the codebase easy to navigate and extend. Configurable: Easily adjust hyperparameters and file paths through a central config.yaml file, ensuring flexibility and quick experimentation. Visualization and Reporting: Comprehensive performance reports with visualizations, including confusion matrix and classification report, saved as images for easy reference. Getting Started Installation: Clone the repo and install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt. Usage: Run main.py to execute the full pipeline, or explore individual scripts to customize preprocessing, model training, or evaluation. Highlights This project is ideal for researchers, data scientists, and network security enthusiasts interested in SDN security, particularly DDoS detection. By combining traditional machine learning techniques with deep learning, it offers a robust approach to anomaly detection in network traffic.
